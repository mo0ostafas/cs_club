        "quote": "I like to share my experience with the club One of the beautiful things that I knew how to benefit from the club is that I knew how to mix with a beautiful society of young guys but all of them have one goal development and self improvement especially what motivated me more to deal and interact with the guys in addition to agreeing in the goal But also that we are in the field of technology and programming In general I was happy that I knew how to leave even a small effect on some beautiful guys who were trying to take care of the club and work hard as much as they did I can and the other side is that I dealt with mentors like me and I took more experience and advice than them on the basis of the same category I would like to conclude and this is not the last experience There are other experiences that I was very happy with the diverse ideas of the guys not only in the field of technology Some of them are god willing who are interested in the Quran and who are interested in reading and know novels and who have culture and who praise God started to make links accounts that And he started to enter the world of seriousness and endeavor from a young age although children like him in Distractions from football and series and others so I hope that God will help these guys and write them good and continue on the path they are in and I thank the instractour Mustafa for the effort he made with us and he did his best at all and he was responsible. Thank you so much."

        "quote": "I entered this club because I had a passion about AI and programming and I wanted to enter that world and be a part of it. My motivation was that I wanted to be a game developer because when I was bored I didn't find a game I like so I decided to learn and make one and from my search I found that the perfect gate would be python so I started to see where can I learn it. I  saw a message for the club marketing and I enrolled in it. The club helped me to understand python and learn things like lists and loops ..etc. and I was able to make a small Program like a small data base. The sessions were something else it was so easy to understand and there were applications and tasks to make sure you understand. The team was so understanding and they stopped giving tasks in the final exams time."
